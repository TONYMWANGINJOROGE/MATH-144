This repository contains my personal data project for MATH-144.  
The analysis explores the relationship between Real GDP and Nominal GDP.

## 📈 Summary

- Real GDP and Nominal GDP show a strong positive relationship.
- Inflation causes nominal GDP to grow faster than real GDP.
- A linear regression confirms this pattern with a very high R² value.
