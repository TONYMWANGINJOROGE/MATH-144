## Visualization

Below is my visualization summarizing economic growth patterns:

## Summary

- Real GDP and Nominal GDP show a strong positive relationship.
- Inflation causes nominal GDP to grow faster than real GDP.
- A linear regression confirms this pattern with a very high R² value.

  
**Description.** Scatterplot of Nominal GDP vs Real GDP (Post-1980) with a fitted regression line.  
The plot shows a strong positive relationship between the two variables, where Nominal GDP rises
faster due to inflation, causing an upward curve in later years.
